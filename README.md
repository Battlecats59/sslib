This is still under heavy development, be careful to use it!

## Installing
You need:
- python3
- install the requirements.txt, note that binaries for nlzss11 are only available for windows and linux (for now)
- The Skyward Sword ISO, dumped from disc, any official version will work. It has to be in a directory named `actual-extract`, so that it contains the directories `DATA` and `UPDATE`

## Running
