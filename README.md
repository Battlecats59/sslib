This is still under heavy development, be careful to use it!

## Installing
You need:
- python3
- install the requirements.txt with `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`, note that binaries for nlzss11 are only available for windows and linux (for now)
- The extracted Skyward Sword ISO, dumped from disc, any official version will work. It has to be extracted using tools like `wimms ISO tools` and has to be placed be in a directory named `actual-extract`, so that it contains the directories `DATA` and `UPDATE`

## Running
TODO

### Tests
`python3 -mpytest test`  
Make sure to have the extracted game prepared as stated in Installing, otherwise they won't work
